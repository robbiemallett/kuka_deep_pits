KuKa on land snow near Caboose
Date: 07/08/2023
Conditions: Windy from NE

Snow was scanned by KuKa over 5 locations along a transect at 5 m intervals. Ku-scat scanned first followed by moving the sled to have Ka scat, followed by Ka scat scan the snow. A metre scale was used to measure the distance from bottom of both antennas to the snow surface. This procedure was followed at all 5 locations. Once KuKa scanning was complete, 3 snow pits were dug at locations 1 (7 July), 2 and 5 (both on 8 July) till the firn/maximum diggable layer was found. No TLS measurements were made due to tilt compensation issue (later fixed in the lab)
